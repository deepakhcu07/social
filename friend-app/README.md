## Friend Management ##

### Technical Requirements
- Java 8
- Maven 3+

### How to run
1. `mvn clean install`
2. `java -jar target/friend-api-xxxx.jar`

### User Stories
In a social application, there are users. Any two users can be connected as a friend or a user can subscribe or block any other user. 

### Documentation
For Documentation, I have used the swagger API. Swagger help us to write the API document in the code. 
We can find all the details about the API End Points documentation at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.

I have assumed users data and all the connection, subscriptions are done from the user data. My API first validates whether the user exists or not. To test the application easily, I have defined 2 APIs 
1. /users/bulk-create
	Documentation: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/User_Management_API/createUsingPOST_1`
2. /users/dummy-data
	Documentation: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/User_Management_API/createDummyUserUsingPOST`
	This API creates 20 Users in the system. The patterns of the users are
	abcD@example.com
	xyzD@example.com
	The D is from 1 to 10
	
#### Exceptions
I have defined three exceptions in the applications.
1. `InvalidDataException` This exception is thrown if the Request Entity is not valid to process on the server. 
For Example: Email is not valid or the expected value or size does not match the API requirements.
2. `ResourceAlreadyExistApplication` This exception is thrown when you try to create friend which is already friends.
3. `UserNotFoundException` If the given user is not found on the server, this exception is thrown.
